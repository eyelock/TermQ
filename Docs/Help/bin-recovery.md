# Bin & Recovery

## Soft Delete

When you delete a terminal, it's moved to the Bin instead of being permanently removed. This gives you time to recover accidentally deleted terminals.

## Accessing the Bin

- Click the **Bin** button in the board view toolbar
- Use **⌘⇧⌫** from anywhere

## Bin Features

- View all deleted terminals with deletion date
- See how many days remain before auto-deletion
- **Restore** - Bring a terminal back to the board
- **Delete Permanently** - Remove immediately
- **Empty Bin** - Clear all deleted terminals at once

## Auto-Cleanup

Deleted terminals are automatically removed after a configurable period (default: 14 days). Change this in Settings > Bin.
