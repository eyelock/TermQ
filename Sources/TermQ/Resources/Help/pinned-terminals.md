# Pinned Terminals & Tabs

## Pinning Terminals

Pin frequently-used terminals to access them quickly via tabs.

- Click the ⭐ button on a card or in the toolbar
- Use **⌘D** to toggle pin status
- Pinned terminals appear as tabs at the top of the focused view

## Tab Navigation

- Click a tab to switch to that terminal
- Use **⌘]** and **⌘[** to cycle through pinned terminals
- Hover over a tab to see Edit and Delete buttons

## Smart Behavior

- Creating a new terminal while focused auto-pins it
- The current terminal always shows as a tab (even if not pinned)
- Deleting a tab focuses the adjacent tab instead of returning to board
