# Tips & Tricks

## Productivity Tips

- **Command Palette (⌘K)** - The fastest way to switch terminals or run actions

- **Quick Terminal (⌘T)** creates a terminal with the same working directory as the current one - great for parallel tasks

- **Zoom Mode (⌘⇧Z)** - Hide tabs for a distraction-free terminal experience

- **Pin your most-used terminals** to quickly switch between them with ⌘] and ⌘[

- **Use badges** to show quick identifiers like "prod" or "local" on terminal cards

- **Use tags** to add metadata like `env=prod` or `project=api` for easy identification

- **Init commands** can auto-run commands when a terminal starts (e.g., `npm run dev`)

- **Smart paste warnings** protect you from accidentally pasting dangerous commands

- **Right-click cards** for quick access to edit, delete, and pin options

- **Tab hover actions** let you edit or close terminals without switching to them first

- **Drag columns** to reorder them on your board
